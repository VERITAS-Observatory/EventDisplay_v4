Improve efficiency of IRF calculation (lower storage footprint; introduce possibility to re-calculate all stereo parameters (MSCW, MSCL, emission height, direction, core, energy) on the `mscw_energy` level for 3-telescope events from 4-telescope MC simulations. This is for MC events only and used to simplify and accelerate the analysis required for the generation of effective areas.)
