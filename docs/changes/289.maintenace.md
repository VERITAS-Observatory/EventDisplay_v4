Replaced many ROOT auto-generated header/source files (e.g., CData.h, CEffArea.h, CRunSummary.h, Cshowerpars.h, Ctpars.h, Ctelconfig.h) with hand-edited or cleaner C++ code, improving maintainability and readability. Moved implementation code from `.C` files to `.cpp` files, and deleted the old `.C` files.
Adjusted several functions and constructors to reflect changes in how data and reconstruction methods are handled (e.g., CData and related classes now use cleaner, more explicit constructors).
Functions that previously accepted "version" or "short" flags via integers now use explicit booleans for clarity.
Removed the CEffFit class and related files.
Pruned unused variables and methods, including some internal variables in VTMVAEvaluator, VTableLookupDataHandler, and others.
Removed outdated warnings, TODO comments, and deprecated features.
