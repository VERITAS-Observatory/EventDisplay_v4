Introduced new functionality for reconstructing events using any three telescopes out of four (primarily for Monte Carlo data and effective area calculations).
Added new class: `VMeanScaledVariables` for mean scaled variable calculations.
Updated VDispAnalyzer and VSimpleStereoReconstructor to support new reconstruction modes and calculation methods.
Updated VInstrumentResponseFunctionRunParameter and related code to include new parameters for 3-telescope reconstruction.
