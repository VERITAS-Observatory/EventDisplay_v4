- reduced storage impact of `mscw_energy` branch (mostly due to change of doubles to floats; removal of unused variables); reduction is on storage requirements is ~25%.
- efficiency improvement in running `mscw_energy` -> 20% faster
- fine-tuning of docker build scripts to improve build efficiency
- add code to redo stereo reconstruction to `CData.cpp`. Functions are named `reconstruct_3tel_images*`
- generalized calculation of MSCW, MSCL, MWR, MWL variables in new classes `VMeanScaledVariables`
- allow to recalculate `dispBDTDirection` and `dispBDTEnergy` in `VDispAnalyzer` from values per image
- several important improvements and bug fixes in stereo reconstruction code in `VTableLookupDataHandler`:
	- `Chi2` from direction reconstruction not correctly filled from `showerpars` trees
	- bug fix in setting of `NImages` and selected telescopes for 3-telescope runs (function `fill_selected_images_before_redo_stereo_reconstruction`)
- clarified that `Erec` is from `dispBDTEnergy` while `ErecS` is from simple lookup table reconstruction. Change default values for `EnergyReconstructionMethod` to `Erec` (method ID `0`) for `anasum` and `effective area` code.
- introduced consistent naming of tree reader support classes. Moved them from `.C` to `.cpp`. Removed obsolete code in these files.
- removed `Version` from `CData` class initialize (as it is read from tree doc string).
- removal of `CEffFit.h` classes (not used anywhere)
- bug fix in SizeSecondMax calculation for 3-tel reconstruction using in `mscw_energy` the `rec_id` option (no image selection was applied)
- maintenance and cleanup of obsolete files (see PR #294)
