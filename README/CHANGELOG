*************************************************************

Changes from v35x to v400
=========================

Note: the list below tries to summarize the most important changes
      between v35x and v400. It is not complete and it doesn't give
      a weight to the changes according to their significance.

general
    general cleanup and removal of many obsolete functions
    removed a lot of code duplication
    added and clarified comments
    in many places clearer function and variable naming
    simpler structuring of the code
    much simpler usage for general user (hopefully...)

documentation
    added README directory with up-to-date READMEs
    started a tex-based manual (doc directory)

environmental variables
    changed and improved handling of environmental variables
    (can easily change between between CTA and VERITAS settings (or any other observatory))

Changes in evndisplay
=====================

* EVNDISP (VTS) pointing classes
    Use directly pointing directions from database or pointing monitor 
           (v35x: differences of DB values to expected pointing direction were treated as pointing errors)
           This improves slightly the results (many values are functions of ze, az).
           Allow now the consistent analysis of runs taken orbit mode (but: for a complete analysis of orbit mode runs changes in anasum are necessary)
    New setup of pointing classes: VPointing, VSkyCoordinates, VSkyCoordinatesUtilities
    Major cleanup of the pointing code

* EVNDISP (VTS, CTA) pedestals calculation
   fixed bug regarding reading of pedestal events using -teltoana=2 (or anything different then 1) for grisudet sims

* EVNDISP (VTS) zero-suppression cuts
    fixed handling of reading of number of samples per event to allow the analysis of zero-suppressed runs (tested with run 58914)
    write number of zero suppressed channels to output trees; 
    updated display to plot zero suppressed channels correctly
    
* EVNDISP (VTS) QADC mode
   adjusted raw data reader to work with VERITAS QADC mode (e.g. run 62728, 62988)
        
* EVNDISP (VTS): low-gain calibration
    fixed calculation of low-gain pedestals
    added a new calibration file (calibrationlist.LowGain.dat) with validity ranges for low-gain runs
    added small class to combine results from two low-gain flasher runs (VPedestalLowGain)
    added low-gain calibration files (lped) to calibration directory for most recent years
    fixed handling of low-gain multiplier in code (now strictly dependent on summation window)
    added parameter to low-gain calibration file (calibrationlist.LowGain.dat) to give a mean low-gain multiplier per telescope 
    (key word LOWGAINMULTIPLIER, can be given for a certain run range)
    
* EVNDISP (VTS, CTA-FADC Mode): tzero calibration
   added a new TZERO calibration mode (runmode=7) to calculate average tzero for each pixel. 
      This is used for event where no pixels survived the first pass in doublepass
      Added this additional pass to all scripts
      test show significant improvement at low energies in gamma reconstruction
    
* EVNDISP (VTS, CTA-FADC Mode): summation windows
    introduced three summation windows: 
       i) short window for best sensitivity (used as well in second pass of doublepass): returned with getSumWindow() or getSumWindow_1()
       ii) long window to minimize systematics in energy reconstruction (used for size2 calculation): returned with getSumWindow_2()
       iii) summation window for first pass in double pass method: returned with getSumWindow_Pass1()
    Major cleanup in the code. Removed all 'small' variables for double pass second windows
    fixed summation window settings for short readout windows (do not allow to have longer calibration windows then the readout window is)
       
* EVNDISP (VTS, CTA-FADC Mode):  trace handler, charge integration and energy reconstruction
    calculation of integrated charge (sum) per image simultaneously for two summation windows 
        (long: size2 and short: size in tpars tree)   
       The long window is used in the lookup table code for reconstruction of energies. 
    Allow now to add easily new charge integration method (and some have been added)
    Allow telescope-type dependent selection of trace integration parameters
    Added sliding window integration method (not default).
    Added calculation of weighted mean pulse time.
    Cleanup and optimization of trace handler.
    Fixed bug in overflow of saturated low-gain traces for GrISU simulation using external noise files
    Fixed settings of long summation window for pixels on low gain (go back to old style by using command line option -fixwindow2=0)

* EVNDISP (VTS, CTA-FADC Mode): DST
    fixed and improved analysis using DST files
    added FADC traces to DST files (note: large impact on file sizes)

* EVNDISP (VTS, CTA) command line parameters moved to a new parameter file
    trace integration and cleaning parameters are moved to a parameter file 
    (see example file EVNDISP.reconstruction.runparameter)
    
* EVNDISP (VTS, CTA): global run parameters
    moved all VERITAS dependent parameters (e.g. database location, UCLA archive) into external parameter files (EVNDISP.global.runparameter)
        added observatory to this file (height, latitude, longitude)
    
* EVNDISP (VTS, CTA): image cleaning
    several different cleaning methods are available:
    TWOLEVELCLEANING: classical cleaning
    TIMECLUSTERCLEANING and TIMENEXTNEIGHBOUR (both work in progress, expert use only!)
          Allow now different cleaning parameters and method per telescope type.
        All image cleaning parameters are now handled by a class (VImageCleaningRunParameter)

* EVNDISP (VTS, CTA): image parameter calculation
    added minimum number of tube fit for log-likelihood reconstruction
    changed default loss value for  log-likelihood reconstruction from 0 to 10% (LL does not perform very well for small images)
    added lossAndDead image parameter (fraction of size at the edge of FOV + as neighbour of dead pixels) 
    optimized fitting (use now only pixel values from image + surrounding ring; was: whole camera)
    cleanup and simplification of function calls in image parameter calculation
    
* EVNDISP (VTS, CTA): quality cuts for stereo reconstruction
    removed all size cuts, use only one for all cuts. Default values are ntubes>=3, size > 100 and loss < 0.5

* EVNDISP (VTS, CTA): output file: image parameter trees
    added counting of saturated channels; old nsat is now called nlowgain
    added size2 for image size for long integration window
    removed max[0-2] and index_of_max[0-2] from short trees (saves on file size)

* EVNDISP (VTS, CTA): core reconstruction
    fixed problem with parallel images in 2-image events (gave previously NAN for core positions)

* EVNDISP (VTS, CTA):  direction reconstruction
    default method is now the reconstruction of shower and core direction by mean value of intersection value of pairs of intersecting image lines 
    (Hofmann et al 1999, Method 1 (HEGRA method))
    weight depend on image size, elongation of images (width/length), angular separation between image axis
    This method is more robust to ill reconstruction image lines (weighting takes care of this)
    Direction reconstruction is independent of grisu methods.

* EVNDISP (VTS, CTA): modified disp angular reconstruction
    added a modified disp angular reconstruction method (work in progress, expert use only)
    
* EVNDISP (VTS): reading run info from DB
    Added second try for connection with DB server (connection fails sometimes when many jobs are started simultaneously). 
    Wait 10 s for second try.
    
* EVNDISP (VTS, CTA): display
    optimization work to handle more telescopes
    minor fixes to handle events without FADC traces (DSTs)
    fixed annoying color problems in camera plotter

    (does not affect any standard analysis)
  loglikelihood fitting of Template shower images to data and Monte Carlo.

mscw_energy (lookup tables)
=======================

* MSCW_ENERGY (VTS, CTA) lookup table file
    change table handling to reduce file size (new lookup tables are a factor of 7 smaller than old ones)
    all information is now in a single table tree
    remove unfilled bins from lookup tables and reduce histograms  (this is done in the merging of lookup tables in combineLookupTables) 
    default reconstruction ID is now '0' (note that no other reconstruction IDs are needed for the standard analysis)
    significant update on table writer and reader; simplification and performance improvements
    bug fixes: (sum of log values is not the same as log of the sum...)
    fixed inconsistent selection of methods for array variable filling
    use selected images from eventdisplay stage for mean scaled and energy reconstruction (before: used all with decent values)
    added plotter for lookup tables
    added additional checks that evndisplay input files are in healthy state 
        (can be important for MC files, where the MC histograms are the last objects written to the evndisp file)
    
    
effective area and instrument response function calculation
==============================================

*  EFFECTIVE AREA CALCULATION (VTS) merging of effective area files
    fixed several small bugs to handling missing root files
    
*  EFFECTIVE AREA CALCULATION (VTS, CTA), IRFs
    completely rewrote IRF calculation
    added energy resolution a la CTA
    
* EFFECTIVE AREA CALCULATION (VTS, CTA)
    filling MC histograms of thrown events now already at eventdisplay 
    (no necessity to copy trees with MC parameters through the lookup table code, saves orders of magnitudes (!) in disk space)
    major cleanup
    factors of 10-20 performance increase due to different optimization
    added counting of multiple CORSIKA events
    added histogram with unweighted (no spectral weights) events after cuts
    added time dependent effective area code
    improved plotting of effective areas and angular/energy resolution
    added cut on maximum distance of reconstructed shower core to next telescope ("telcoredistance")
    changed order in filling of debug histograms (to keep better track of effect of cuts)
    
* EFFECTIVE AREA CALCULATION (VTS, CTA): spectral weighting
    fixed important cuts important for MC with energy spectra unequal to -2
    optimization
    
gamma-hadron separation
=====================

* CUTS (VTS, CTA): size cut
    SizeSecondMax replaces now all size cuts in the analysis
    (no size cut in stereo reconstruction in eventdisplay)

*  CUTS (VTS, CTA): direction cuts
    cleaned up direction cut section and added parameter to choose the correct one (fDirectionCutSelector)
    implemented energy dependent theta2 cut  (for Monte Carlo only)
    
* CUTS (VTS, CTA):  TMVA based gamma-hadron separation
    added TMVA based gamma-hadron separation (several classes)
    additions to anasum cuts and effective areas to handle this
    added training code and scripts
    (this is 90% tested, still expert use only)

* CUTS (CTA):  telescope type dependent image multiplicity cuts
  allow for example to require at least 2 LSTs, 3 MSTs and 5 SSTs

* CUTS (VTS, CTA):  gamma/hadron statistics
    added class to keep track of different gamma/hadron cuts
    
radial acceptance curve calculation
============================

* RADACCEPTANCE (VTS): I/O
    made code more robust against missing input files
    write cuts to acceptance files (to keep track of them)
    
ANASUM (all VTS)
===============

* ANASUM: energy reconstruction method (lookup tables)
   changed default energy reconstruction method to 1 (tables with lg size on X-axis)
   method 1 shows inconsistencies at low energies (no strict proportionality between size and energy) and event losses at high energies
   Note that the plan is to replace the lookup table based energy reconstruction method by something more sophisticated (NN or BDT)

* ANASUM: spectral energy and flux calculation
    propagated bug fixes from v354 and 355 (first and last bin in spectral energy distribution)
    fixed Rolke upper limit calculation for alpha != 1
    Usage of Li & Ma significance calculation equation 5 in spectral classes.
    The default is now the Rolke method, which should work better as well for the small event numbers we often have.
    Rolke is as well the default for the upper limit calculation
    fixed error calculation to be Poissonian
    Added Rolke based flux calculation (no negative fluxes) (optional)
    added time dependent filling of effective area histograms: allows higher precision for intra-run light curves
    added more functions to spectral fitter (curved and broken power laws)
    
* ANASUM: phase cuts
    allow cuts on phase (e.g. for pulsars or binaries)
    general cleanup
    
* ANASUM: astro classes
    removed (VAstroSource) and replaced by VSkyCoordinates (code was partly duplicated)
    VTargets is made obsolete in most cases, only kept for backwards compatibility
    added VSkyCoordinatesUtilities for most used simple functions
    
* ANASUM: sky map and histogram plotting
    general cleanup
    critical bug fixes related to calculation of distance for current epoch and J2000 coordinates
    (all coordinates away from the sky-map centre were calculated incorrectly)
    fixed long-standing bug in RA axis plotting (was time-zone dependent)
    
sensitivity calculations
==================

* SENS (VTS, CTA): differential and integral sensitivity calculator
    expanded and cross-checked extensively the sensitivity calculation
    implemented sensitivity requirements from CTA
    added errors
    added many debug features and tests

* SENS (VTS, CTA): CTA WP Phys files
    added writer for CTA WP Phys files
    added plotter for CTA WP Phys files
    
tools
====

* (VTS): Crab rate calculator from MC 
    several bug fixes and additions to take new effective area format into account

* (VTS) data base tools
    fixed seg fault in reading of run comments in VRunStats
    
* (VTS): light curve tools
    added new tools to make, plot and analyze light curves (VHE and XRT) -> see Manual
    phase dependent light curves, 
    ZDCF analysis 
    Lomb Scargle analysis
    added different consistency tests for ZDCF and LS
    
* (VTS) balloon data analysis
    fixed macro and script to download and analyse balloon data

scripts
=====

* (VTS, CTA): script for batch cluster
    updated and improved scripts to run a large data set on a batch cluster
    
comparison of data and MC
======================

* (VTS) compareDatawithMC  (former stereoCompare)
   compare MC simulations of gamma rays with excess events from data: removed obsolete code;
   updated pointing classes
   added MVA variables
   improved and added new plotting routines

downloading data from UCLA
=======================
   
* (VTS) VTS.getRunListFromDB
   significantly improved run list generator using the VTS data base
   replaces old perl scripts
